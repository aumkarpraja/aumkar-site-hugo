Hey there, my name is Aumkar. I'm a DevOps Engineer at a great company called Statflo, located in lovely Toronto, Ontario. I graduated in 2018 from Ryerson University with a BSc in Computer Science.

I dabble in a lot of things when it comes to my field of work but I've found myself settled in the DevOps field. Now DevOps is a huge container term for a lot of different things but I've spent my time fusing full-stack development work with things typically done in DevOps like packaging up applications and sending it off to the cloud via my favorite flavor of infra-as-code software (usually Terraform).

My other areas of interest include gaming, photography and hiking. While the last two go along just fine together the first one is a beast of its own. For photography, I personally use a Sony a6500 along with a 30mm prime + a 18-135 zoom lens. 

While I'm still working my way through learning the ins and outs of the DevOps field along with finding the perfect fusion of Full Stack work and DevOps work. My career goal is to be able to use the skills I've developed in my time working at Indellient to enable more developers to look beyond DevOps as just "IT for developers" and see it as something more.
